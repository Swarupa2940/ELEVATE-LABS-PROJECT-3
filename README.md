# ELEVATE-LABS-PROJECT-3
This Node.js script uses Express to create a simple REST API server.

It stores book data in memory using an array (books) and assigns each book a unique ID.

The server supports CRUD operations: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for managing books.

Each endpoint handles validation, searching, or updating books by their ID.

The server runs on http://localhost:3000 and can be tested using Postman.
